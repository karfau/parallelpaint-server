ParalellPaint
- Paint for the browser
- drawing objects instead of painnting with brushes
- just start: no registration required for painting
- like a wiki: every registered user can collaborate
- multi-user: registered users can edit a painting in paralell
- the drawing elements have the following editable attributes:
	position, color(fill/stroke), alpha(fill/stroke), stroke-width, existance ;)
- each drawing has its own url for sharing
- PNG-/JPG-export
- posibility to take snapshots from a drawing that are not editable
- more to come ... ?

The project was developed by 
Chr. Bewernitz (alias karfau, mainly client, http://github.com/karfau/parallelpaint-client) 
and A. Semt (mainly server, http://github.com/karfau/parallelpaint-server)
for Multi Media Engeneering 2 @ Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin in summer term 2010

In its current state ParalellPaint is a prototype and should not be used productive.
Before having a final version there will have to be a lot of improvements 
regarding performance and elegance of the already implemented features, 
primarily in the server-side of the project.

Details about the server:
It uses/was developed with
- Tomcat 6
- BlazeDS 4
- MySQL 5 
- Eclipselink as JPA2 implementation
- Spring 3
- Spring BlazeDS Integration 1.0.3
- Spring Security 3
using SpringSource Tool Suite IDE 2.3.2 (based on Eclipse 3.5.2)
